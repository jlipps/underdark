Our heroes converse with a bunch of gang members and try not to die, or be died. (How do you like
that example of a passive intransitive?) After they make it out of that particular jam (or do
they?), it's time to learn a bit more about Evendur and then take care of our fantasy nightlife
responsibilities by getting ready for an awesome party.
