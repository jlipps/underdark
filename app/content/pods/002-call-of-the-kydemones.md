We begin the story! This is a rather short one, because while our characters are getting their
proverbial sea legs under them, so are the players behind them. We're figuring out how to play and
how not to die in the forest. Most of us are successful in the latter, but Orwin almost doesn't
make it! It's a rough first day on the job, to say the least.
